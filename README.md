# aeromodeling-throw-meter
Simple and easy throw meter for your model
based on an ADX345 and an Arduino nano to provide a cheap way to 
measure the angle and mm deviation displayed on a small Oled display
Nothing fancy, just brut force average computing to get a stable measure of the ADXL345
I hope this can be useful for some people....

This is still an ongoing project.... even if it is up and running some tweaking may be requiered, and as usual this may contain undocumented features (also called bugs in other environments)

>>Edit 20180705
>>I added a new version of this angle & throw meter based on a 12bits sensor MMA8452
>>the MMA version runs the same way as the version based on the ADXL345 but it adds accuracy 
>>also the push button is now sensed using an interrupt

Have fun
